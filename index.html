        <h2>Hi, my name is Jonah</h2>
        <p>I am a 20 year old Cybersecurity student at Brigham Young University, orginally from Arizona! This page is more about me</p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>I was originally born in Provo, Utah, while my Dad was attending BYU law school. We have since lived in Maryland, California, Utah, and Arizona. I have 6 siblings, and also a twin brother. My 18 year old brother is living in Ohio serving as a church missionary. The rest of my family is living in Arizona. Although I am the only one in my family living in Arizona, luckily I have many cousins that also attend BYU.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies and Interest</h2>
        <p>I really like learning and spending time outside, here is a list of things that I like to do:
            <ul>
                <li>Pickleball</li>
                <li>Hiking</li>
                <li>Coding</li>
                <li>Eating Taco Bell</li>
              </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Mission in New York City</h2>
        <p>From June 2022 to June 2024 I was living in New York City as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Every day for 2 years I taught people about God and Jesus Christ, and spent a lot of time serving others. It was an incredible experience and I learned so much! I also spent 6 of those 24 months serving in Connecticut where I made so many friends that I still keep in touch to this day. </p>
